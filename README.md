# sudoku-solver
The original problem was to solve a given sudoku (of the standard 9x9 size). I wanted to solve this problem with as little guess-and-check (i.e., guessing the value of an entry of the board and checking if it leads to an invalid board) as possible. To make this worthwhile (and more interesting) I decided write the program so that it would handle an n^2 x n^2 sudoku for n. 

The program includes a GUI that allows a user to enter an initial state of the sudoku, and contains two buttons for solving and resetting the board.

See pdf entitled "sudoku solver summary" for a description of the class Solver.
